# LLM-Experiments

As LLMs are taking over the world, this repo contains experiments with regards to LLM. The code provides a few simple examples of how to use large language models (LLMs) using Langchain.

In case you did not know, LLMs are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of content, and answer user's questions in an informative way.

- **Text generation:** This example shows how to use an LLM to generate a name of a child.
- **Prompt and User inputs:** Prompts are an important building block of LLM applications. This extends the previous text generation with prompts.

## How to use it

1. use a virtual environment to create new environrment
2. install the requirements (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Now you can run the app.py
